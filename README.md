WARNING FOR THOSE WITH PHOTOSENSITIVE EPILEPSY OR OTHER SENSITIVITY TO FLASHING LIGHTS

I call it: Begging for Boredom

s/o to Jason Shaw, whose music is included. Find him here:

Learned a lot about JS, including its limitations:
  -can't find easy way to trigger events from the script
  -bizarre rectangle effects from divs at higher dimensions
But also learned:
  -insane number of ways to refresh page
  -declare eventlisteners' functions so you can remove them later if need be
  -try to manipulate things through CSS if you can instead
  -basic CSS principles, including flex, inline-block, background principles, and manipulation from JS
  -a bunch of other stuff that I'm likely forgetting right now!
  
And most importantly, how to stick with something until it has all the functionality I'd like it to.
I'm a serial project-starter-but-not-finisher. Although I'm frankly a little tired of working on this thing,
I'm really satisfied with having produced something that at least works in the basic ways I set out to at the start.

Thanks to The Odin Project for helping me get over my Java snobbery.
